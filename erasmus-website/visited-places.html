                    <h3>Ostrava</h3>
                    <p>When I first arrived in Ostrava, it was very interesting because it was completely different from the structure of
                    Turkey. When I first arrived in Ostrava, I visited the New Town Hall and the city center. I went around the city and
                    shopping malls. I also took a walk by the Ostravice River.It was also quite pleasant to visit the Ostrava zoo. I quite liked the city and house structures of Ostrava and it was interesting.</p>

                    <h3>Prague</h3>
                    <p>Prague was one of the most beautiful cities I have visited in my life. It seemed more interesting to me because I like
                    Franz Kafka. I visited places such as Kafka's Rotating Head, Kafka Museum, Infinity Books in a library, Prague Castle, the Dancing
                    House, the Charles Bridge, the Astronomical Clock Tower. It was one of the most enjoyable cities to visit.</p>

                    <h3>Paris</h3>
                    <p>My visit to Paris was also one of the places I enjoyed the most. When I arrived in Paris, my first visit was to the
                    Eiffel Tower. I came across a very beautiful sight. Then I went to the Louvre Museum. I visited the Champs-Elysees
                    Avenue. It was quite enjoyable.</p>
